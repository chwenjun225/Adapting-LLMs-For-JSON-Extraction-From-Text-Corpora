# Adapting Large Language Model for JSON Extraction from Text Corpora

## Abstract 
In recent years, Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in understanding and processing natural language. This paper explores the adaptation of LLMs, specifically LLaMA2-7B, for the task of extracting structured JSON data from unstructured text corpora. By fine-tuning the model with methods such as Quantized Low-Rank Adaptation (QLoRA) and Fully Sharded Data Parallel, we aim to enhance the efficiency and accuracy of JSON extraction. The model was trained on a customized dataset to optimize its performance in this specific task. Experimental results show that our approach significantly improves extraction accuracy compared to traditional methods, providing a robust solution for converting textual data into structured formats. This research contributes to the field by demonstrating the potential of LLMs in automating data extraction processes, which can be beneficial for various applications in data analytics, information retrieval, and natural language processing.

## Introduction
In the era of big data, extracting structured information from unstructured text is a critical task for various applications, including data analytics, information retrieval, and natural language understanding. JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) has become a standard format for representing structured data due to its simplicity and ease of use. However, extracting JSON data from raw text remains a challenging problem, especially when dealing with large volumes of diverse and complex textual corpora.

Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently shown exceptional performance in various natural language processing (NLP) tasks, thanks to their ability to understand and generate human-like text. Models like GPT-3 and LLaMA2-7B have demonstrated the potential to comprehend context and generate structured responses. Despite these advancements, the application of LLMs for directly extracting structured data, such as JSON, from unstructured text has not been fully explored.

This paper addresses this gap by investigating the adaptation of LLMs for the task of JSON extraction from text corpora. Our approach focuses on fine-tuning the LLaMA2-7B model using techniques such as Quantized Low-Rank Adaptation (QLoRA) and Fully Sharded Data Parallel. By training the model on a customized dataset, we aim to enhance its ability to identify and extract structured data in the form of JSON.

The primary objective of this research is to develop a method that improves the efficiency and accuracy of JSON extraction compared to traditional methods. By leveraging the advanced capabilities of LLMs, our work aims to provide a robust solution for converting textual data into structured formats, thereby facilitating data processing and analysis in various domains.

In the following sections, we discuss the related work in the field, describe our methodology in detail, present the experimental results, and conclude with potential implications and future research directions.

The end of the road begins in Cincinnati. The legendary rock 'n' roll band Kiss is closing out a 50-year career, but before the band packs away its iconic makeup and wild costumes, the boys are taking one last ride around the world with a final tour, fittingly titled the "End of the Road" tour. It will span 50 dates around the world, and the North American leg kicks off Oct. 19 right here in Cincinnati.

Tickets go on sale Friday, June 9, for the show, which will take place at Heritage Bank Center (100 Broadway, Downtown). The tour wraps up in December with a massive final show at Madison Square Garden in New York City.

Concert dates:Cincinnati's full 2023 concert calendar ðŸŽµ

Kiss was formed in New York City in 1973 by members Paul Stanley, Gene Simmons, Ace Frehley and Peter Criss. With greasepaint makeup and outrageous costumes, the bandmembers took on the personae of comic book-style characters, and their "shock-rock" style live performances have been known to feature fire-breathing, blood-spitting, levitating drum kits and pyrotechnics. Considered one of the most influential rock bands of all time and one of the best-selling bands of all time, Kiss has sold more than 75 million records worldwide, earned 30 gold albums, and all four original members have been inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.

The current lineup includes Stanley, Simmons, guitarist Tommy Thayer and drummer Eric Singer.

- **Multi-GPU Training**: Utilize multiple GPUs to speed up the training process.
- **FSDP**: Fully Sharded Data Parallelism to optimize memory usage.
- **QLoRA**: Quantized Low-Rank Adaptation for efficient model finetuning.
- **Gradient Checkpointing**: Save memory by checkpointing intermediate activations.
- **CPU Offloading**: Offload computations to CPU to further optimize GPU memory usage.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
